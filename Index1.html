            <h3>5.2 Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Robotics has already made a substantial impact on healthcare, particularly in surgery and rehabilitation. These technologies offer significant benefits in terms of precision, outcomes, and patient recovery. However, challenges related to cost, training, and ethical considerations must be addressed to ensure equitable access and responsible implementation.</p>
            <p>As robotics continues to converge with artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and biotechnology, we can expect increasingly sophisticated systems that will further transform healthcare delivery. The ultimate goal remains unchanged: to improve patient outcomes, enhance the capabilities of healthcare professionals, and make high-quality care more accessible to all.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Final Recommendation:</strong> Healthcare institutions should develop strategic plans for robotic technology adoption that include comprehensive training programs, ethical guidelines, and assessment frameworks to evaluate clinical and economic outcomes. Policymakers should consider regulatory frameworks that balance innovation with patient safety and equitable access.</p>
